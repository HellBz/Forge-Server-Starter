# Forge-Server-Starter

With this you can now start FORGE 1.17.x servers.

**The Hoster keeps the full control**,<br>
because all start parameters are passed directly to the FORGE file.
<br>
<br>
In addition,i dont print only the log output via console, <br>
you can also write into it and get immediate feedback.<br>
<br>
The forge version is searched and started, <br>
also the unix_args.txt or win_args.txt (depending on the system)<br>
is checked for an entry like XMX or XMS, because we want to keep control over it.

Example: My Server ;)<br>
5.83.164.33:12800<br>
Server can be joined with Vanilla, only Servermod Tree-Harvester is loaded.
