# Forge-Server-Starter

With this you can now start FORGE 1.17.x servers.
Nitrado keeps the full control, because all start parameters are passed directly to the FORGE file.
In addition, I have not only the log output via console, but you can also write into it and get immediate feedback.
The forge version is searched and started, also the unix_args.txt or win_args.txt (depending on the system) is checked for an entry like XMX or XMS, because we want to keep control over it.

Example: My Server :zwinkern:
( 5.83.164.33:12800 )
Server can be joined with Vanilla, only Servermod Tree-Harvester is loaded.

• Upload all Forge-Files
